## Introduction

In this GitHub project, we will focus on the main analysis types, specifically the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and Customer Segmentation. As a data analyst working in a growing e-commerce shop, we are tasked with gaining a deeper understanding of the business and assessing the justifiability of marketing spending. 

## Problem Statement

The main problem at hand is to calculate the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for the e-commerce shop's customers. This metric is essential for understanding the long-term value that customers bring to the business and assessing the profitability of marketing efforts.

## Solution

 we will address the follow-up task which involves using cohort analysis to calculate CLV. We will adjust our calculations to include all users who have visited the website, not just those who made a purchase. Furthermore, we will focus on a weekly perspective using cohorts, considering that customers tend to stay for a maximum of 12 weeks with the e-commerce site. Cohort analysis will provide us with more reliable and actionable results for estimating future revenue.

We will create visualizations using Google Sheets, showcasing the revenue/registrations for each weekly cohort as a cumulative sum. These visualizations will help us understand the growth trends and allow us to predict future revenue based on historical data and average cumulative growth. Finally, we compare the business take rate and customer acquistion cost(CAC) to make an effective decision.
